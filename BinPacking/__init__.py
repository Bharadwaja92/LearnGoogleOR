"""""""""

Bin packing is the problem of trying to find a set of objects to pack into containers (or bins). 

The objects have weights (or volumes), and each container has a capacity, which is the total weight (or volume) the 
container can hold. There are many variants of the problem: the objects can have different values whose sum should be 
maximized, sizes along different dimensions whose sums must adhere to certain limits, and there might be many containers 
or just one.
