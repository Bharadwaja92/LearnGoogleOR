"""""""""
Constraint optimization, or constraint programming (CP), is the name given to identifying feasible solutions out of a 
very large set of candidates, where the problem can be modeled in terms of arbitrary constraints.

CP is based on 'feasibility' (finding a feasible solution) rather than 'optimization' (finding an optimal solution) and 
focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function. In fact, a CP problem may not even have an 
objective function â€” the goal may simply be to narrow down a vary large set of possible solutions to a more manageable 
subset by adding constraints to the problem.
