What is an optimization problem?
The goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions. 

An Optimization problem has the following elements:

The objective—
The quantity you want to optimize. In the example above, the objective is to minimize cost. 

To set up an optimization problem, you need to define a function that calculates the value of the objective for any 
possible solution. This is called the objective function. In the preceding example, the objective function would 
calculate the total cost of any assignment of packages and routes.
An optimal solution is one for which the value of the objective function is the best. 
("Best" can be either a maximum or a minimum.)

The constraints— 
Restrictions on the set of possible solutions, based on the specific requirements of the problem. 
For example, if the shipping company can't assign packages above a given weight to trucks, this would impose a 
constraint on the solutions. 

A feasible solution is one that satisfies all the given constraints for the problem, without necessarily being optimal.

The first step in solving an optimization problem is identifying the objective and constraints.
