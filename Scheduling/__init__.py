Employee Scheduling

Optimization problems that involve assigning resources to perform a set of tasks at specific times are called 
scheduling problems. Complex scheduling problems frequently arise in the manufacturing industries, as well for airline 
and package delivery companies. Typically, the goal of such problems is to find a schedule that minimizes the total 
amount of time (or cost) required to complete all the tasks.
